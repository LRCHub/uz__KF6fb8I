There's a little girl crying out for help
She's always used to leaning on herself
When she's hurt and scared she runs and hides
As an adult it's the tears she cries
Fell over, skinned my knees a million times

When life got in my way
I stood up to face the day
And even in the hardest times
I could hear you say

Get out of bed the sun is rising
Open your eyes don't waste a moment
Now to spread my wings, learn how to fly
Just me, myself and
I found a way to carry on
Need no one else to stand up tall
Then I found the strength to get me by
Just me, myself and I

There's a woman, she's standing on her own
You'd never know she fears being all alone
Yet she lights her way, protects herself
She guards her heart wIth all she's got
At some point I learnt I had to open up

When life got in my way
I stood up to face the day
And even in the hardest times
I could hear you say

Get out of bed the sun is rising
Open your eyes don't waste a moment
Now to spread my wings, learn how to fly
Just me, myself and
I found a way to carry on
Need no one else to stand up tall
Then I found the strength to get me by
Just me, myself and I
Me, myself and I

When life got in my way
I stood up to face the day
And even in the hardest times
I could hear you say

Get out of bed the sun is rising
Open your eyes don't waste a moment
Now to spread my wings, learn how to fly
Just me, myself and
I found a way to carry on
Need no one else to stand up tall
Then I found the strength to get me by
Just me, myself and I
Me, myself and I
Me, myself and I

I found a way to carry on
Need no one else to stand up tall
Then I found the strength to get me by
Just me, myself and I
Me, myself and I
