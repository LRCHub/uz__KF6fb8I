Written by Anna Vaus
I was in the tenth grade
When I stepped on the scale and weighed 100 plus my age
I thought that I was heavy
Like damn, that's kinda heavy
So I would go on a run
Tell my mom that it was for fun
Did the same thing til I was twenty
And damn, that's kinda heavy
This is a love song to a younger version of myself
Trying to be somebody else,
Who says you're not beautiful
An anthem for the girl who cries herself to sleep
But keeps on fighting for her dreams
Baby fight like hell
This is a love song to a younger version of myself
I know it's hard to speak up
You don't like to let people down
But God gave you something to say
So you better make it loud
And they might not listen, they might reprimand you
But it's not your job to make them understand you
I know that you feel like you don't fit in
But all the best never did
This is a love song to a younger version of myself
Trying to be somebody else,
Who says you're not beautiful
An anthem for the girl who cries herself to sleep
But keeps on fighting for her dreams
Baby fight like hell
This is a love song to a younger version of myself
This is a love song to a younger version of myself
Trying to be somebody else,
Who says you're not beautiful
An anthem for the girl who cries herself to sleep
But keeps on fighting for her dreams
Baby fight like hell
This is a love song to a younger version of myself
