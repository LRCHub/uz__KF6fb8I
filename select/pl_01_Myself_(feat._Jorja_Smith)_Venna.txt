Da-dum-da-dim,
dum-da-dum-dum
Dum-dum-dum, doo-doo
My heart won't save me for
what I do
It's not something
I could've left outside of this
See, my heart does more to me
My mind knows I shouldn't
get into this
Please believe I held back
the kissing
But you pull me in like
it's okay
You show me love just for
the day
Losing myself is only wise
if I will grow
Finding it out is always
harder if you know
I come at the end in the middle
I can't fall,
I can't till I get out
Losing myself is only wise
when I grow
Choosing myself before
I lose myself
Choosing myself before
I lose myself
Choosing myself before
I lose myself
Before I lose myself
Losing myself,
sometimes a loss
without fighting
(Without fighting)
Still on my way,
tryna hide what I'm hiding
Love isn't to blame
but if I try,
I will find it
Lost in his ways, oh, my God,
I can't explain it, no
Oh, my God, I can't explain it
Oh, my God, I can't explain it
Love isn't to blame
but if I try,
I will find it
Lost in his ways, oh, my God,
I can't explain it, no
Oh, my God, I can't explain it
Oh, my God, I can't explain it
